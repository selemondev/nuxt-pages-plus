# Introduction

Nuxt Pages Plus enhances the routing capabilities of [Nuxt Pages](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/pages), allowing for rapid development of complex routing scenarios.

## Why Nuxt Pages Plus?

[Nuxt Pages](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/pages) leverages the powerful file-based routing of [vue-router](https://router.vuejs.org/), enabling developers to easily build and manage routes with excellent DX. However, complex scenarios can require significant development time.

To provide a seamless and out-of-the-box solution, Nuxt Pages Plus as a [Nuxt Module](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/concepts/modules), uses auto imports and hooks to preprocess routing. It offers a diverse array of components, composables, and flexible configurations, allowing developers to maintain a high-quality DX while using Nuxt to develop versatile applications and scenarios.

### 

## Inspiration

Nuxt Pages Plus us inspired by Next.js [App Router](https://app-router.vercel.app/). It's Parallel Routes and Intercepting Routes features, demonstrate effective solutions for developing dynamic routing scenarios. We aim to bring similar functionalities to Nuxt by introducing Nuxt Pages Plus as a module, allowing developers to easily integrate and utilize these advanced routing features based on their project requirements.

Many thanks to [Anthony Fu](https://github.com/antfu) for his valuable advice on implementing the Parallel Routes feature within the Nuxt framework.
