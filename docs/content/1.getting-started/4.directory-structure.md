# Directory Structure

All named parallel routes page files should be placed in the [`~/pages/`](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/pages) directory. Nuxt Pages Plus will process these files and generate parallel routes after Nuxt has generated the routes.

## Named Parallel Routes

You can place your parallel routes pages directory file with `{route}@{name}` format.

| File Path                  | Name  | Generated route     | Description                       |
| -------------------------- | ----- | ------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `index@foo.vue`            | `foo` | `/`                 | name in index file                |
| `@foo/index.vue`           | `foo` | `/`                 | name in root folder               |
| `@foo.vue`                 | `foo` | `/`                 | name in root folder without index |
| `about/us@foo.vue`         | `foo` | `/about/us`         | name in file of folder            |
| `about/us@foo/contact.vue` | `foo` | `/about/us/contact` | name in sub folder                |

### Nested Named Parallel Routes

Nuxt Pages Plus supports nested name file-based routing, which can be used in nested named parallel routes.

| File Path              | Name      | Generated route | Description                    |
| ---------------------- | --------- | --------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `@foo/@bar/about.vue`  | `foo/bar` | `/about`        | nested name                    |
| `about@foo/us@bar.vue` | `foo/bar` | `/about/us`     | nested name in file and folder |
| `@foo@bar/about.vue`   | `foo/bar` | `/about`        | multiple nested name in folder |
| `about/us@foo@bar.vue` | `foo/bar` | `/about/us`     | multiple nested name in file   |

### Escape `@` separator

Supporting named parallel views could lead to conflicts with certain routes, e.g. including the `@` symbol in the route. Nuxt Pages Plus provided some options to address this problem.

#### Customize separator symbol

This allows you to use `index+foo.vue` as Parallel Routes. ([Example](https://github.com/serkodev/nuxt-pages-plus/tree/main/examples/parallel-separator/nuxt.config.ts))

::code-group
```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  pagesPlus: {
    separator: '+',
  },
})
```
